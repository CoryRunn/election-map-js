Here is a JavaScript project I did through www.Skillcrush.com. I was given the HTML, CSS, and a third-party map.js file to work with. My job was to make this election results map interactive.

As you hover over each state, the color changes to indicate the winner of that states election (each canidate was assigned a color). There is also a table in the lower right hand corner that list the votes and winner as you hover over each state. The table at the top list the total country votes and declared winner. Poor Kermy :(

This project taught me more about how to use variables, objects, properties, functions, factory functions, methods, arrays, if/else, DOM, JS Bin, trouble shooting and the Console.
